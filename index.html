  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: [Insert Date]</em></p>

  <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app (“the App”), designed for university students seeking to meet new friends.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you create a profile and use the App, we collect the following personal information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Full name</li>
    <li>Email address (must be a university email ending in .ac.uk or .edu)</li>
    <li>Sexuality</li>
    <li>Gender</li>
    <li>Year of study</li>
    <li>University course</li>
    <li>Profile picture</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is provided voluntarily by you when creating or editing your profile.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>We use your data to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create and display your profile to other users of the App.</li>
    <li>Allow you to find and connect with other university students.</li>
    <li>Improve the app’s functionality and user experience.</li>
    <li>Ensure compliance with our platform’s rules.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your data or share it with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All user data is securely stored using <strong>Google Firebase</strong>, a cloud-based backend service with industry-standard encryption and access controls.</p>
  <p>We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data from loss, misuse, or unauthorised access.</p>

  <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Under UK and EU GDPR (as well as certain US laws like CCPA), you have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access the data we hold about you</li>
    <li>Correct or update your personal data</li>
    <li>Delete your personal data</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent at any time</li>
    <li>Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (e.g. the UK Information Commissioner’s Office)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Most of these actions (viewing, editing, deleting your data) can be done directly through the app.</p>
  <p>If you are unable to access your data or have questions about how it is handled, you can contact us at: <strong>[insert your email address]</strong></p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain your personal data only for as long as your account is active. If you delete your profile, your personal data will be permanently removed from our systems.</p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This App is intended for university students aged 18 and over. We do not knowingly collect data from users under 18. If we become aware that data has been collected from someone under this age, we will delete it promptly.</p>

  <h2>7. International Users</h2>
  <p>If you are located in the United States, please note that your data may be stored and processed in the UK or other countries where our service providers operate. By using the App, you consent to this transfer and processing.</p>
  <p>We aim to comply with both <strong>GDPR</strong> (UK/EU) and <strong>CCPA</strong> (California) where applicable.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes in the law or our practices. Any changes will be posted within the app, and we encourage you to review it periodically.</p>
